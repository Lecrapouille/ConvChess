On the long road when the spirit flags and enthusiasm wanes, we surely need 
people who encourage you and many a time a push from them is all you 
need. This work could not have been accomplished without the contributions from 
various people around. Now that I stand near the end of my thesis, I would like 
take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude towards each and every one 
of them.

Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis 
supervisor, 
Prof. Amitabha Mukerjee, for his constant motivations and high expectations 
that kept me going. 
I am grateful to him to have given me enough freedom to explore the wonderful 
area of Artificial Intelligence, while guiding me whenever my steps faltered. I 
would also like to acknowledge Prof. Vinay Namboodiri for the worthwhile 
discussions about research in the areas of Machine Learning and Computer 
Vision. I also thank him for providing me with the learning experience as a 
Teaching Assistant for the Machine Learning for Computer Vision course. Finally, 
I would like to thank Prof. Thorsten Joachims for having induced in me a 
research aptitude of the highest quality and a critical mindset towards the 
research findings. I feel these qualities were of utmost importance for me as a 
student researcher while working towards this thesis.

I think my thesis would not have been a success without the excellent open 
source community we have in Computer Science, especially in the field of 
Machine learning, for building tools that enables students such as me to utilize 
state of the art techniques for the larger good of the community. 

A big thank you to all my department friends and my wing mates for making my 
stay in campus an enriching experience. Last, but the most, I 
thank my parents for always being there for me and supporting me in every 
decision that I have taken.
